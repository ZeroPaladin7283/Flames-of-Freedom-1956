                    Iâ€™m playing through the game for the third time, and I just discovered a secret room in the basement
                    where you can use the codes from an old radio station to listen to secret messages! The audio
                    materials are fascinating and open up new threads in the story!

                    Guys, I found an awesome Easter egg in front of the Corvin Cinema! If you wait long enough during
                    one of the scenes, you can hear a hidden dialogue about a secret shipment that unlocks a new side
                    quest! ðŸ˜Ž It's a bit tricky, but totally worth it!

                    I never thought that if I didnâ€™t help the wounded resistance fighter in one scene, the story would
                    take a completely different direction! I encountered entirely new characters and unlocked new

                    An honest review of the game after 50 hours of gameplay. <br>
                    Spoiler Alert! I canâ€™t believe that when I finally figured out that the protagonistâ€™s uncle is
                    actually a double agent for the revolutionary movement, everything I thought I knew about the story
                    was turned upside down! The twist was so well-written that I have to play again with different
                    choices!
